This is a assignment of Java class. Here is its description:

In this assignment you will get practice working with Java arrays, and more practice implementing your own
classes. Like you did in assignment 1 and lab 4, you will be implementing a class whose specification we
have given you, in this case a class called SolitaireBoard, to represent the board configuration for a specific
type of solitaire game described further below. You will also be using tools to help develop correct code, such
as assert statements along with code to verify that your class implementation is consistent.

Solitaire Game:

The game starts with 45 cards. (They need not be playing cards. Unmarked index cards work just
as well.) Randomly divide them into some number of piles of random size. For example, you
might start with piles of size 20, 5, 1, 9, and 10. In each round you take one card from each pile,
forming a new pile with these cards. For example, the starting configuration would be
transformed into piles of size 19, 4, 8, 9, and 5. The solitaire is over when the piles have size 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. (It can be shown that you always end up with such a
configuration.)
